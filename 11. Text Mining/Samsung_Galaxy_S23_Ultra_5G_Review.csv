This is the best Android has to offer",5.0,"I'll keep it short and direct.-Great in hand feel. The aluminium frame and glass back feel nice to hold.- Probably the best screen. QHD, Really bright, and high refresh rate.-Amazing battery life. I charge my phone to 85% and with a screen on time of about 6-7 hours get home with more than 40% left.-Great cameras. Not even gonna get deep into it.-The Spen is wonderful to use. Really helped improve my productivity.-One ui is probably my favourite Android skin and with Android 14 it's even better.-Samsung will provide updates for this phone for 5 years. That coupled with the fact that Samsung offers the cheapest repair options in India mean you don't really need to worry about getting a new one for the next 5 years.-And yes it takes calls and no network issues.The only thing this phone doesn't do is make coffee .If it is in your budget, you would not get a better phone than this. That is until the next one comes out.", 2 December 2023

The best smartphone money can buy!",5.0,"After using Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for quite a bit as a daily driver and coming back to Samsung after a long time after using other smaller form factor phones like ONEPLUS 9, here's what I think about this phone.PROS:- This phone has the best camera ever installed into a smartphone, hands-down! No other phone made in human history can ever come close to 1% of what Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's cameras can do.- Performance is crazy! Not only it has Snapdragon 8Gen-2, but that too custom-made for Samsung Galaxy phones. You can play any games, run any apps and do whatever you'd want from a phone that is used at work, gaming, taking photos/videos and for personal use at the same time.- Rectangular form factor of this phone makes it so much comfortable and easy to hold. And it looks very premium too, which obviously is expected from a phone that costs this much.- OneUI has so many great features that they cannot be listed in one place. It brings a whole new meaning to ""smart"" in smartphones. Previously only Apple was making real smartphones that were actually smart and now with OneUI 5.1, Samsung has joined the league and probably done a better job than Apple at this point.- Good Lock modules + OneUI 5.1 has such a tremendous level of customization in terms of many aspects of the usability. It doesn't have all of it, to which I'll come in ""CONS"" section.- Charging time is good, reverse charging and wireless charging are such a sweet add-on that helps and makes the experience really good.- S-Pen does the wonders! Very useful specially for those who use their phone for professional work like eSigning and other precision work.- Build quality and software are really premium, you'll know you've sold a kidney when you hold this phone in your hands and turn up the max resolution on display.- S23 Ultra is slightly more flat on sides as compared to S22 Ultra which makes it a more usable phone.CONS:- Now, since this phone has a curved display which adds no usability but makes it little difficult to use for people with smaller hands or to reach to corners with one hand, it becomes little hard to get used to this kind of display even if you've used a curved display phone with smaller form factor before because S23 Ultra is HUGE!- Another issue with curved screen, since there's a decent curve in screen, finding a screen protector is really hard! Tempered glasses don't fit well, they get spaced by covers/cases, Samsung officially doesn't make tempered glass for S23 Ultra. Samsung sells a thin membrane sheet for ‚Çπ1,500/- which has a cutout for camera and collects dust. Having no screen protection means having your second kidney at risk too!- No charger in the box (ugh) and the cable that comes with it is really flimsy. Doesn't look like it came with a flagship phone. ONEPLUS makes 10x better cables so better buy one from them.- A phone this expensive should have all the necessary features right? But the OneUI 5.1 doesn't come with an app lock. Samsung Secure Folder is nice but not usable for a day-to-day use. Secure Folder is fine for hiding images and apps but not convenient for daily access. There's no Good Lock module to have app lock either.- OneUI 5.1 (unlike many other UIs like OxygenOS 13 and ColorOS 13) doesn't give option to rename apps in app drawer. Ability to use 3rd party icon packs just came recently. And installing a 3rd party launcher kind of ruins the UI for recent apps screen.- OneUI 5.1 requires installation of a 3rd party Good Lock module to even configure what icons will appear on your navigation bar.- Overall this is a really good phone, best I'd say! But OneUI 5.1 lacks some basic features which should've been implemented.- But other than these minor software issues and some hardware inconveniences, this phone is definitely a recommendation.", 7 May 2023

Amazing phone but oversharpened images.",4.0,"First of all, this was my last smartphone purchase from Amazon as they are complete frauds. I was denied a replacement and return pick up was fraudulently cancelled multiple times over a period of 3 months. Avoid buying smartphones from online portals because the authenticity and customer support will always be doubtful. Coming to the phone, It‚Äôs a very good phone with excellent battery life and very little overheating issues that plagued the S22 ultra. However, the bane of buying a phone from Samsung is the over-processing and over-sharpening of images from the default camera. This continues to be an issue after several years and updates.

Received a defective product, chasing customer support for replacement",1.0,"I ordered this on 1-Jul Sat day and got it delivered in few hours time. Delivery was super fast. However , the phone is having issues - the call volume sound is too low, I can barely hear other side talking in home..in traffic it's almost impossible. The charging port has issue, if we move the wire slightly during charging, it will stop charging. In the car also, android auto disconnects with slightest bump.

I received notification from Amazon and the call the customer service today only to know that the technician marked the issue as resolved. I was very surprised to know this. I logged a complaint with Amazon customer care, they now asked to wait for 48 hours and they will call back, so waiting..will update in this review once I hear back, hoping it will resolved properly.All in all, not a good experience so far with this purchase, one lesson learnt is not to buy high-end phones in Amazon anymore, it's very agonizing..yesterday I visited a nearby Samsung cafe and the gentleman also said not to buy high-end phones online.

It's been super smooth and I've received a lot of compliments for my photos (Hey maybe that's also some part due to my skill, yes?).But the phone has a great battery life, quite often I'd come back home with around 50% battery (with BT and Loc on).  Mostly not with Power Saver on, but I did keep it on on some days initially.I hardly use the S-pen, mostly due to no habit, but it seems a cool addition for those with smaller hands. For me, I have giant Hands, so i can easily use the entire phone with my two hands.I would recommend this phone if you are looking for a premium product.

Worth it if you are okay with the size",5.0,"I am coming from s20 fe 5g, everything feels like an upgrade, the screen, the build,  the display, the battery, the speakers. The only think that is still taking time to get used to is the size of it, it's a huge phone, wished it was a tad smaller to like 6.3inch and it would have been in a sweet spot for one hand use. This is the phone to last for several years to come without needing any upgrades.", 15 March 2023

Pricey one but best Samsung phone yet",5.0,You can buy it if you can afford it but be sure to protect it as it comes with hefty price. If you are coming from iPhone and want to copy all photos then do it at the time of setting up. I found the battery is regular if we clone iPhone data. If we setup as a fresh phone then it may give good battery life., 19 March 2023

Best smart phone till date",5.0,Upgraded from my galaxy note 9 and I am liking the performance. The camera is easily the highlight of this phone. It takes stunning photos and videos.
